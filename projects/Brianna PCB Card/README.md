Brianna PCB Card

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
I'm working with my school's S.T.E.M. club to make a cute PCB board that'll link people to my instagram. This way I can stay in touch with new people I meet!
<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
This'll cost $37.20
<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
When designing, I found trial and error to be very helpful. I deleted and re-pasted the same image many times to try and get the sizing to my liking.
